            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p><b>Wolfgang Weingart</b> is a well known graphic designer and typographer. He is also known as <b>'the father'</b> of
the <b>'new wave'</b> typography. He gained popularity and exposure for his experimental work with
traditional Swiss typography. </p>

        <section id="early">
            <h2>Early Life</h2>
           
            <p>Weingart was born in February 1941, in Salem Valley, Southern Germany close to the Swiss border.</p>  

            <p>In April 1954 he moved Lisbon, Portugal and lived there for two years, Wolfgang describes this time as; <i>"The
                most important years of my life".</i> There he enrolled in the German School of Lisbon and his artistic skills
were noticed by his teacher who provided him with private lessons so that he could develop them
further. Lisbon was also a quality time in his life that he has spent with his parents, they took him on
many trips during the holidays visiting different places but in particular the Arabic countries which gave
him a better cultural and visual knowledge. These experiences would then inspire his works and designs
later on in life. </p>

            <p>When he returned back to Germany his parents enrolled him for the Merz Academy in Stuttgart where
he started a two year programme in Applied Art and Design. Learning the art of production by designing
and sketching designs using different mediums. He also worked on personal projects in his free time
which included hand setting type and print, during these projects he first used the metal type.  </p>

        <section id="app">
            <h2>Apprenticeships</h2>
            
            <p>In 1960 Weingart started a three year typesetting apprenticeship at Ruwe Printing. During this time he
came to contact with Swiss typography. In these years he has mastered techniques of letterpress
printing and wanted to experiment his newly gained skills. Weingart experimented with letters and type
their positioning and compositions. The experimenting lead to unusual letter spacing and duplication of
type on pages. There he met with the company’s consulting designer, Karl-August Hanke, who became
his mentor and encouraged him to study in Switzerland. In 1962 he decided to work with only the letter
'M', this project would help him through many years to come as it questioned; size and positioning of
type on pages and how they would look from different perspectives. It was curiosity that influenced him
to combine different type with the letter 'M' to produce different patters and designs. He gained the
knowledge to manipulate the letters by duplicating, bending and twisting the work within the pages.

            <p>After he had completed the apprenticeship at Ruwe Printing in March 1963, he moved to Basel,
Switzerland where he enrolled in the Basel School of Design. There he met Armin Hofmann which was
                impressed by the skills and work of Weingart. In his book <b>'My Way to Typography'</b> he mentions;
<i>"Hofmann's enthusiasm led me to believe that I would be accepted as a student".</i> At Basel he was taught 
by Armin Hofmann and Emil Ruder, they have aided his experimental work of type by providing him
access to large work spaces within the school. Weingart would decide to work at Ruwe Printing whilst
studying to investigate lino and woodcut illustrations as he wanted to improve the newly acquired Swiss
style. </p>

            <h2>Swiss Typography</h2>
            <p>It was founded during World War II at the Bauhaus but In the 1950's there was a design movement that
is seen by many people as the most important graphic design style of the twentieth century. I was mostly
used in Switzerland, Russia and Germany, and although mostly known as the Swiss Typography it is also
known as the <b>'International typographic style'</b> due to its global recognition. The style became to be very
much connected with corporate and political design with the emphasize on being eye-catching and
readable. This was because a lot of political posters have used the style. It is also fairly known for its
basic use of colours and simplicity.</p>

            <p>Admin Hogmann and Emil Ruder Weingarts teachers and biggest influences were enthusiasts of the
Swiss Typography but Weingart was not much of a fan of the structured and basic design that is why he
experimented. Weingarts process was unusual as he took slabs of wood and screwed metal hooks into
them creating a grid format that was common in the Swiss designs, then he would have turned some of
the hooks in a 45 and others to a 90 degree angle to form different patterns and compositions. Later he
would ink them and print them on a letterpress, as this was the process he was most comfortable with as
he worked as a typesetter. </p>

        <section id="work">
            <h2>Work</h2>
            <p>Weingart decided to finish his project he had started few years prior. This was known as the <b>'M Project'</b>,
he stretched, duplicated, angled, printed and pasted the letter onto a cube. Then he proceeded to
photograph the letter from different angles, this lead to many abstract compositions and versions of the
letter. This was done in back and white for easy visibility of the compositions and patterns that were
created in the process. He said that most of his work reminded him of murals and sculptures he
witnessed at a young age when he traveled with his parents. </p>

            <p>The so called <b>'new wave'</b> work included poster, as Weingart loved the combination of type and
photography and fell in love with photo montage. The experimental work was a mixture of typefaces,
letter spacing and photos. He used offset printing processes to create these poster that appeared both
complex and chaotic but every much attracted the eye of a viewer with their colours and originality.
Later on these posters became his most famous and beloved works as they were something unseen and
conventional. When creating these posters Weingart was inspired by Dada collage which was produced
by layering type and images on top of one another to be then photographed to create one single image. </p>

</div>            
            
            <p>One piece of work that was truly admired by others was the 1984 exhibition poster of the <b>'Matterhorn'</b>,
he got his inspiration by crumpling up tissue forcing it onto a page and photocopying it, this was seen as 
sheer brilliance as it gave an effect not seen before at that time. It's his thinking outside the box and
experimentation that attracted many people to his work. </p>

        <section id="teach">
        
            <h2>Teaching</h2>

            <p>In 1968, he began to teach typography at Basel School of Design, where he previously attended after
Armin Hofmanns invitation after completion of the course. He began to teach Advance Program for
Graphic Design, he left Basel in 2005 after gaining life time popularity and became an instructor at the
Yale University Summer Graphic Design program in Brissago, Switzerland. He continued to lecture all
around the globe, in places such as Australia, Asia, Europe and North and South America for 40 years. He
                has provided a lot of knowledge for the upcoming designers in the industry.</p>

            <p>He encouraged all of his students to experiment with the same goal to test the limits of readability of
their type work not just relations and combinations between type positioning, size, weight and letter
spacing. All of the students were allowed creative freedom and experimentation as Weingart wanted to
push the limits of 'the norm' that he was taught. Because of this students got very familiar with this type
of 'style' and dubbed it <b>'Weingart style'</b> also known as the <b>'New Wave'.</b> </p>

                <blockquote><i><p>"I took 'Swiss Typography' as my starting point, but then I blew it apart, never forcing any style upon my students. I never intended to create a 'style'. 
                It just happened that the students picked up — and misinterpreted — a so-called 'Weingart style' and spread it around.”</p></i></blockquote>

        <section id="award">
            <h2>Awards</h2>

            <p>Over the years Wolfgang Weingart has received some worthy awards; In 2005 MassArt awarded
Weingart the honorary title of Doctor of Fine Arts. In 2013 Weingart was a recipient of the AIGA Medal,
which is the highest honor of the design profession. He recieved it for his typographic explorations and
teaching in the industry. In 2014 Weingart received the Swiss Grand Prix of Design award, presented by
the Federal Office of Culture for his lifelong merits as a designer. </p>

        <section id="conclusion">
        
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Weingart had a great understanding of typesetting and didn't stick to 'the norm' of design, this led him
to pursue a more experimental approach to his designs. Weingart has a lot to thank for Swiss typography
that was around his time of come up as it was because of Swiss typography he became an international
success in the 1960's. Weingart wanted a whole new perspective on the teaching of typography by
looking at was the common principles of its practice and removing them for unlimited creativity in
design. He broke the rules because he knew them inside out. </p>
            
            <p>I don't think Weingart intended for his style to become this popular, he was just doing something
personally for himself but other saw it as something great. </p>
            
            <p>He had a huge impact on graphic design industry as he helped to break apart 'the norms' that were set
by others previously and if you see him as a typographer, a graphic designer, a teacher, an inventor, the
father of 'New Wave' or just a rebel and deserves to be named one of the greatest in his craft. </p>

technique"- Wolfgang Weingart.</p></i></blockquote>
